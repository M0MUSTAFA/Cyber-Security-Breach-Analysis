🛡️ Cyber Security Breach Analysis
📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing cyber security breaches reported across the United States. Using Tableau, we explore breach trends, the number of individuals affected, types of breaches, and attack surfaces from which data was compromised. The data visualizations aim to provide insights into patterns that organizations and analysts can use to identify vulnerabilities and improve security strategies.

🗂️ Dataset
Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) - Office for Civil Rights breach reports

Attributes include:

Covered entity and business associate names

Number of individuals affected

Type of breach (e.g., Theft, Hacking/IT Incident)

Location of breached information (e.g., Paper, Laptop, Network Server)

State and year of the incident

📌 Key Insights
1. Individuals Affected by State
States such as California, Texas, and New York report the highest number of affected individuals.

These states show significantly higher breach impact, which may correlate with larger healthcare systems and populations.

2. Breach Trends Over Time
A sharp rise in breach counts began around 2009, peaking in 2012–2013, followed by a gradual decline.

Increased reporting and digitization may explain the upward trend during this period.

3. Type of Breaches
Theft is the leading cause of breaches, followed by unauthorized access/disclosure and hacking/IT incidents.

Combined breach types involving multiple vectors (e.g., Theft + Unauthorized Disclosure) are also significant.

4. Attack Surfaces
The most frequently breached surfaces include:

Paper Records

Laptops

Desktop Computers

Email and Network Servers also pose notable risk.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tableau: Used for creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations

Excel / CSV: For data cleaning and preprocessing
